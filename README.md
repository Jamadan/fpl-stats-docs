# fpl-stats-docs
Living documentation for use cases, user stories, math calculations and algos

1 Use cases for stats:

a) I have a hunch about FPL and want more information from an aggregated data source that I trust

b) I'm looking for inspiration for my FPL team and want to see what the smart data-driven moves would be

c) I want to validate a decision I'm planning to make with reputable, relevant data



2 What factors could be used (how could they be quantified)

a) Form of the player I'm considering: How many goals, assists, CSs, FPL points have they scored recently (~5 GWs)? How many minutes have they played recently? How likely are they to start?

b) Status of player I'm considering: How many goals, assists, CSs, FPL points have they scored in the last 2/3 years, how central are they to their team's attack/defence (xGI?)

c) Motivation of player I'm considering: Chasing a move, individual/team record, international call-up, point to prove to manager/fans/press

d) Players record vs oppo: How many goals, assists has the player scored in their last 5 meetings with the oppo

e) Form of teams they're facing: Position in table, results of last 5 games, difficulty of teams faced in last 5 games

f) Motivation of teams they're facing: Other priorities (cup comps/Europe), table position (fighting for lives, safe from relegation at end of season)

g) Key personnel matchups: Availability, form, quality of direct oppo on pitch (ST vs CB, LW vs RB, etc.) 

h) Bookies odds: Player to score/assist anytime, Oppo to score (No), line on spread for game

i) FPL specific considerations: How widely owned is player (globally, in top 100/500/1000), do my rival(s) own them, will my rival(s) captain them
